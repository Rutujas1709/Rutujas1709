### Hi there üëã

I'm Rutuja Sonawane, 

I am a highly motivated computer science graduate student with a strong passion for the ever-evolving world of technology. My academic background and practical experience have equipped me with a wide range of skills, including data analysis, machine learning, and web development. My goal is to apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems and continuously expand my understanding of the field.

I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at San Diego State University, where I have been focusing on areas like Algorithm Analysis and Design, Full-Stack Web Development, and Machine Learning and Data Science. I take pride in my academic achievements, maintaining a GPA of 3.90/4.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through internships and professional roles. I began my journey as a Technical Support Associate at Mphasis, where I refined my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and troubleshooting. I contributed to process optimization and provided data-driven insights.

During my internship at Riverus Technology Solutions, I immersed myself in data engineering, using PySpark, SQL, and Azure Databricks to build robust data pipelines. I also ensured data accuracy and quality checks during data analysis.

My internship with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) allowed me to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP). I developed NLP models to enhance inference speed and provide valuable analytics. I also contributed to the development of machine learning pipelines for complex text-based captchas.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've come to appreciate technology's transformative potential. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and using my skills to make a meaningful impact.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton, listening to music, and watching movies. Badminton keeps me physically and mentally engaged, while music and movies provide relaxation and inspiration, adding balance to my life.

As I continue my technology journey, I'm excited to embrace new challenges, explore emerging trends, and maintain my commitment to lifelong learning. My portfolio reflects my dedication, skills, and accomplishments, and I eagerly anticipate sharing it with you.
